# River

Functions and classes from the River library that are relevant to the streaming CNMF package. Besides the ones listed
below, River also has a `rolling` module that allows for rolling analyses, `active` module which allows for user
intervention, and a `preprocessing` module that allows for easy creation of feature extractors.

## Drift Detection

Detecting when video characteristics change significantly - For Cell Detection / Merging / Splitting

```python
from river import drift
from river import metrics
import numpy as np

# Initialize drift detector and metric
drift_detector = drift.ADWIN()
metric = metrics.MAE()

class VideoStreamProcessor:
    def process_stream(self, video_stream):
        for frame in video_stream:
            # Convert frame to features (e.g., brightness, color histograms)
            features = self.extract_features(frame)

            # Make prediction and update model
            pred = model.predict_one(features)

            # Check for drift in brightness
            avg_brightness = np.mean(features['brightness'])
            if drift_detector.update(avg_brightness):
                print(f"Change detected at frame {frame_number}")
                # Could trigger model retraining or adaptation here
```

## Running Statistics

Maintaining statistics without storing historical frames - For statistics that are updated as the data streams in.

```python
from river import stats


class VideoStatsTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize running statistics
        self.brightness_mean = stats.Mean()
        self.motion_var = stats.Var()
        self.rolling_mean = stats.RollingMean(window_size=30)  # Last 30 frames

    def update_stats(self, frame):
        features = self.extract_features(frame)

        # Update statistics with new frame
        self.brightness_mean.update(features['brightness'])
        self.motion_var.update(features['motion'])
        self.rolling_mean.replace(features['activity'])

        current_stats = {
            'avg_brightness': self.brightness_mean.get(),
            'motion_variance': self.motion_var.get(),
            'recent_activity': self.rolling_mean.get()
        }
        return current_stats
```

## Time-based Features

Processing video with temporal context - For real-time processing, closed-loop processing, etc.

```python
from river import preprocessing, feature_extraction
from datetime import datetime


class TemporalVideoProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        # Create temporal feature extractors
        self.time_features = feature_extraction.TargetAgg(
            window_size=timedelta(seconds=5)  # 5-second window
        )
        self.activity_window = preprocessing.SlidingWindow(
            window_size=30  # Last 30 frames
        )

    def process_frame(self, frame, timestamp):
        features = self.extract_features(frame)

        # Add temporal features
        temporal_features = {
            'time_of_day': timestamp.hour,
            'day_of_week': timestamp.weekday(),
            'activity_window': self.activity_window.replace(features['activity']),
            'avg_motion_5sec': self.time_features.update(features['motion'])
        }
        return temporal_features
```

## One-pass Learning - Sklearn-like interface

Complete pipeline for online video processing

```python
from river import compose, preprocessing, linear_model


class OnlineVideoLearning:
    def __init__(self):
        # Create an online learning pipeline
        self.pipeline = compose.Pipeline(
            ('scaler', preprocessing.StandardScaler()),
            ('motion_avg', preprocessing.SlidingWindow(window_size=5)),
            ('classifier', linear_model.LogisticRegression())
        )

    def process_stream(self, video_stream):
        for frame in video_stream:
            # Extract features
            features = self.extract_features(frame)

            # If we have labels (e.g., activity detection)
            if label is not None:
                # Learn and predict in one pass
                self.pipeline = self.pipeline.learn_one(features, label)
                prediction = self.pipeline.predict_one(features)

                # Update model performance metrics
                metrics.replace(label, prediction)
```

## Resource Efficiency - I should build a buffer like this

Memory-efficient processing with data windows

```python
from me import SlidingWindowBuffer, utils
import numpy as np


class EfficientVideoProcessor:
    def __init__(self, max_memory_mb=100):
        self.frame_buffer = SlidingWindowBuffer(
            window_size=30,  # Keep only last 30 frames
            min_size=10  # Need at least 10 frames for processing
        )
        self.max_memory = max_memory_mb * 1024 * 1024  # Convert to bytes

    def process_stream(self, video_stream):
        for frame in video_stream:
            # Check memory usage
            if utils.get_memory_usage() > self.max_memory:
                print("Memory threshold exceeded, clearing old statistics")
                self.frame_buffer.clear()

            # Process frame with constant memory
            features = self.extract_features(frame)
            self.frame_buffer.replace(features)

            # Compute statistics on recent frames only
            recent_stats = {
                'avg_brightness': np.mean([f['brightness'] for f in self.frame_buffer]),
                'motion_trend': self.compute_motion_trend(self.frame_buffer)
            }
            yield recent_stats
```

To use all these components together:

```python
class CompleteVideoStreamProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.drift_detector = VideoStreamProcessor()
        self.stats_tracker = VideoStatsTracker()
        self.temporal_processor = TemporalVideoProcessor()
        self.online_learner = OnlineVideoLearning()
        self.efficient_processor = EfficientVideoProcessor()

    def process_video_stream(self, video_stream):
        for frame, timestamp in video_stream:
            # Process frame through all components
            drift_info = self.drift_detector.process_stream(frame)
            current_stats = self.stats_tracker.update_stats(frame)
            temporal_features = self.temporal_processor.process_frame(frame, timestamp)
            predictions = self.online_learner.process_stream(frame)
            efficient_stats = self.efficient_processor.process_stream(frame)

            # Combine results for downstream processing
            results = {
                'drift_detected': drift_info,
                'current_stats': current_stats,
                'temporal_features': temporal_features,
                'predictions': predictions,
                'efficient_stats': efficient_stats
            }
            yield results
```

This implementation shows how River can handle streaming video data with:

- Continuous drift detection to identify changes in video characteristics
- Memory-efficient running statistics
- Temporal feature extraction
- One-pass learning for real-time predictions
- Resource-efficient processing with bounded memory usage

Note that you'd need to implement the `extract_features` method based on your specific video processing needs (e.g.,
using OpenCV for feature extraction). This could include brightness, motion detection, color histograms, or any other
relevant video features.
